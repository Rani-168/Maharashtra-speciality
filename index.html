      Maharashtra[a] is a state in the western peninsular region of India
      occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. It is bordered by
      the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the
      south, Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat
      and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra
      and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.[20] Maharashtra is
      the second-most populous state in India, the third-most populous country
      subdivision in South Asia, and the fourth-most populous in the world.<BR>
      <BR>
      The region that encompasses the modern state has a history going back many
      millennia. Notable dynasties that ruled the region include the Asmakas, 
      the Mauryas, the Satavahanas, the Western Satraps, the Abhiras, the Vakatakas, 
      the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Western Chalukyas, the Seuna Yadavas,
      the Khaljis, the Tughlaqs, the Bahamanis and the Mughals. In the early 19th
      century, the region was divided between the Dominions of the Peshwa in the 
      Maratha Confederacy and the Nizamate of Hyderabad.
      <br>
      <br>
      Early in the 19th century, the British East India Company defeated the Marathas and brought 
      most of present-day Maharashtra under its control, both directly and indirectly through many 
      princely states. After 1858, the British crown assumed control of the area from the company.
      During the periods of Company and British rule, the region was divided between the Bombay 
      Presidency, the Central Provinces, Berar, and many princely states including Hyderabad.
