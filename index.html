    <h2>Maharashtra:</h2>

    <p>
        Maharashtra is special for its 
        <b>
            vibrant culture, diverse geography (from beaches to hills), rich history
            (Maratha Empire), iconic food like Vada Pav, Misal Pav, and Puran Poli,
            famous festivals (Ganesh Chaturthi), and landmarks like Mumbai's Gateway
            of India, showcasing a blend of traditional and modern India.

    <p>
        Maharashtra is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying
        a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. It is bordered by the Arabian
        Sea to the west, Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana to the southeast,
        Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and Dadra
        and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.
    </p>

    <p>
        The region has a history going back many millennia. Notable dynasties include
        the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Yadavas, Bahamanis, Mughals,
        and the Maratha Empire.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the early 19th century, the British East India Company defeated the Marathas
        and brought most of present-day Maharashtra under its control. After 1858,
        the British Crown ruled the region until India gained independence.
